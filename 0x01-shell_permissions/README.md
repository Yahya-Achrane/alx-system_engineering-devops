Switch to Betty Script:
 This script switches the current user to the user account named "betty"
 using 'su' command.
Notes: 
The 'su' command is usually used with the '-' option to fully switch to the new user's environment.But this script does not include that option.
This script assumes that the user running the script has permission to swith to the "betty" user account.
